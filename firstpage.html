        On a desktop computer, a virtual keyboard might provide an alternative input mechanism for users with disabilities who cannot use a conventional keyboard, for bi- or multi-lingual users who switch frequently between different character sets or alphabets, which may be confusing over time, or for users who are lacking a traditional keyboard. Although hardware keyboards are available with dual keyboard layouts (e.g. Cyrillic/Latin letters in various national layouts), the on-screen keyboard provides a handy substitute while working at different stations or on laptops, which seldom come with dual layouts.

Virtual keyboards can be categorized by the following aspects: <br><br>

1.Virtual keyboards with touchscreen keyboard layouts or sensing. <br>
2.Character variants, punctuation, and other special characters accessible through a menu and through holding buttons. <br>
3.Keyboard software may include a number pad feature to facilitate typing numbers. <br>
4.Optically projected keyboard layouts or similar arrangements of "keys" or sensing areas. <br>
5.Optically detected human hand and finger motions. <br>
6.Online virtual keyboards for multiple languages that don't require OS settings change. <br>
7.Depending on which device the keyboard is used (desktop / mobile / virtual reality / augmented reality). <br><br>

On the Internet, various JavaScript virtual keyboards have been created, allowing users to type their own languages on foreign keyboards, particularly in Internet cafes. Multitouch screens allow the possibility to create virtual chorded keyboards for tablet computers, touchscreens, touchpads and wired gloves. <br><br>
